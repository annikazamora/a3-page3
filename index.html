            (Candle is not included). If I were to choose one dessert to eat for the rest of my life I would choose this. I love Mcdonald's vanilla cones and I will not stop talking about them. But you have to get it in a cup so it doesn't melt all over your hands and get all sticky (yuck). I even wrote an essay about vanilla cones in my ARTS 140 course.

            One of the best parts of family gatherings (other than family of course) is the food. My cousin is a great baker and I look forwards to whatever she decides to bake because I already know I will be eating it all up. Not a fan of sprinkles but since there are a countable number of them it's okay. Chocolate is also the best flavour.

            Not typically a huge fan of pretzels because they're always so dry but these weren't dry. I liked the cheese dip, however I'm not sure who decided to put the whole bag of salt on every pretzel stick. Felt quite thristy after every pretzel.

              Never had the urge to watch baseball but I definitely had the urge to get a Loonie Dog, or what I like to call it, a dollar dog. It is quite small but since it's only $1 at the Rogers Centre, this is considered a huge deal. Tried it with mustard where I realized that mustard maybe isn't so bad. This is in the "snack" category because I could eat it in 2 bites.

            This is the best limited edition cake pop design starbucks has created. The cake was vanilla inside, and it literally was so prefect I repurchased another one a few days later. Such a good sweet treat, so sad it's seasonal and not here all year round, but that's what makes it special.

              Honestly did not try all flavours of the donuts because I would actually throw up. Not a big fan of donuts to begin with but I will say the strawberry iced and cake batter are definitely the better ones in this assortment. Definitely not a bad choice for a sweet treat but honestly I like to keep it simple and would much rather have the original glazed donut. You can't beat the classic one.
